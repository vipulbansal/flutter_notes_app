    <h1>Privacy Policy for Flutter Notes App</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: April 13, 2025</p>

    <p>
        Thank you for choosing to use our Flutter Notes App. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, 
        store, and protect your information when you use our application. We take your privacy seriously and 
        are committed to ensuring that your personal information remains secure.
    </p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Flutter Notes App does not collect any personal information.</strong> The app is designed to function 
        entirely offline and locally on your device.
    </p>
    <p>
        All notes and content you create in the app are stored exclusively on your device using Hive, 
        a local database solution. This data never leaves your device and is not transmitted to any external 
        servers or third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
        All data created and managed in the app (including your notes, preferences, and app settings) is 
        stored locally on your device. We do not have access to, nor do we maintain any copies of your data 
        on external servers.
    </p>

    <h2>Automatic Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Analytics and Crash Reporting:</strong> The app does not include any analytics or crash reporting tools that 
        would send data to external servers.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Device Permissions:</strong> The app only requires minimal standard permissions needed to function properly:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Storage access (to save your notes locally)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>
        Since we do not collect any personal information or user data, we do not share any information with 
        third parties. The content of your notes remains private and is never transmitted outside of your device.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        We are committed to ensuring the security of your data. The Flutter Notes App uses industry-standard 
        security measures for local data storage. However, please be aware that no method of electronic 
        storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your 
        information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
    </p>
    <p>
        For additional security, we recommend:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Keeping your device's operating system updated</li>
        <li>Using a device password or biometric authentication</li>
        <li>Not sharing your device with unauthorized users</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Our app does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally 
        identifiable information from children under 13. Since our app does not collect personal information 
        from any users, this includes children under the age of 13.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page 
        periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy 
        on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Consent</h2>
    <p>
        By using our app, you consent to our Privacy Policy.
    </p>
